Models are far too big to include. Run train_all_models.ipynb to build models. Results.ipynb can then be used to analyse the models.

Run_model will allow the user to gather sentiment on specific targets using any specified trained model in the previous step.

Survey is the next step in this project. It is used to extract features of specific targets from the text and calculate sentiment on each target. This however, is not fully compleated and so improvements to increase accuracy on the feature selection may be needed.
